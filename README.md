coreBOS Webservice Development
=======

**core Business Operating System Webservice Development**

This project is a development tool that helps testing the coreBOS webservice (REST) interface.

**NOTE:** This is a **potentially very dangerous application** to have available publically. With very little information anybody can access your data and even write scripts directly into your server (!). This is a **developer's** tool, it should not be deployed on any production server.

For complete details on webservice development [access or wiki](http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:corebosws)

To add examples to this tool just copy them to the testcode directory. If the file has a .php extension it will automatically appear in the PHP code section, if it has a .js extension it will appear in the Javascript example section and if a file with the exact same name but with an .html extension exists it will be loaded into the Documentation section.
